This blog shall address
types of electric vehicle charging station(EVCS), its charging methods, connector guns, modes of charging, compliance testing and certification standards

2 class of charging:
slow charging: AC charging with power rating less than 22kW
fast charging(FC): DC charging

type of charger and location of the charging station:
home charging, workplace charging, and public charging

EVCS classified into 2 groups:
conductive or wired charging: charging of the EVs battery with the use of a power cable or charging cable (direct contact) is classified as conductive EV charging. The charger or cable will be directly in contact with the onboard charger to charge the battery in a controlled manner

non-conductive or wireless charging: charging the EV battery without any direct contact with the vehicle. The charging takes place wirelessly from the charger or wireless induction pads to the receiving induction pad inside the EVs through the use of high-frequency RF signals (in the range of kHz). EVs collect electric power contactless for their batteries from buried high-frequency power cables under the road/charging station surface through magnetic induction or inductive charging. EVs that charge wirelessly are called road-powered EVs or wireless EVs. The main advantage of this type of charging is no cables, only applicable for AC charging and not for DC charging, costly, and placement of wireless charging system.

further classification:
location of use, output-based, input-based, mounting structure-based, based on electric shock and environmental condition.
